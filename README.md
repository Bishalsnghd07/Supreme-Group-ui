## 🧩 Component Architecture Overview

components/

## 📱 Responsive Design Strategy
Mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive utility classes.

Breakpoints used: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl.

Flexbox and Grid layouts adapt content across screen sizes.

Touch-friendly buttons, adaptive typography, and collapsing menus for mobile.

## ⚡ Performance Optimization Techniques
Optimized image formats (WebP where applicable).

Lazy loading for images and non-critical components.

Minimal third-party dependencies to keep bundle size small.

Used Tailwind JIT compiler for faster builds and reduced CSS size.

Excellent result getting in Lighthouse Testing.

## ♿ Accessibility Considerations
Semantic HTML: header, nav, main, footer, etc.

aria-labels added for enhanced screen reader support.

Proper use of alt attributes for images.

Focus states enabled for all interactive elements.

Keyboard navigability ensured for dropdowns and links.

## 📦 Third-party Libraries Used
Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

React Icons – For consistent use of scalable vector icons.

Framer Motion (if used) – For animations and smooth transitions.

clsx – Conditional className utility (if used).

Heroicons – Modern outline and solid icons by Tailwind Labs.

## 🔍 Assumptions and Implementation Decisions
The behavior of certain animations and interactivity inferred from the live site.

Minor responsiveness adjustments made for better UX on extremely small screens.

Figma design interpreted exactly; spacing and font sizes matched using Inspect mode.

Placeholder images used where real assets were missing.

## 😣 Challenges Faced
Aligning exact font sizes and spacing from Figma due to slight rendering differences.

Ensuring cross-browser consistency in layout rendering.

Implementing pixel-perfect responsiveness on edge devices (e.g., foldables, tablets).

## 🧠 Suggested Features and Improvements
Add a content management system (CMS) like Sanity or Strapi.

Integrate multilingual support (i18n) for wider audience reach.

Implement dark/light theme toggle.

Add SEO meta tags and structured data for better discoverability.

Build a contact form with form validation and email integration.

## 📚 Additional Remarks
All development done using modern React with functional components and hooks.

Styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS for maximum control and maintainability.

Project is cross-browser tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.

Fully responsive from 320px to 1920px+ screen widths.
